# Knights and Knaves

Raymond Smullyan's 1978 book of logical puzzles, "What Is the Name of This Book?", consists of a collection of puzzles called "Knights and Knaves" in which the following information is given: 

-Each character is either a Knight or a Knave

-A Knight will always tell the truth

-A Knave will always lie

The objective is to determine whether each character is a Knight or a Knave based on the statements that they make. 
For example, if a character states "I am a knight and a knave," then this is a lie because a character cannot be both. Therefore, the character is a Knave.
